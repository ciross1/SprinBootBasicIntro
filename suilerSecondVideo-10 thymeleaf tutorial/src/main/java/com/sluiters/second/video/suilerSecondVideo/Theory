In the thymeleaf form in the newOrderForm, the form is going to have a post method and it is going to expect an object
so th:object="${order}"    it means what kind of objet is going to be filling in the form

Advice:
Use ${...} when reading values directly from the context or loop.

Use *{...} when inside th:object and working with forms.

In the first page we did in this lesson, addNewOrderForm, just write all the fields from orderModel with inputs
then then the th:action is going to be /orders/addNew

then, we will also create another html file called searchForm, for this one the object is going to be a searchModel and
for that we have to create a new class/model
